Hi there! 
I’m Nima
I’m a passionate programmer focused on machine learning and data-driven projects. I love exploring new ML libraries and technologies, diving into innovative solutions, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with code.

I work on various machine learning projects, tackling challenges and creating impactful solutions.
Experienced with Python, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, and more. I’m always eager to pick up new tools and libraries.
Beyond ML, I’m fascinated by AI applications, data science, and the intersection of technology with real-world problems.
I’m here to collaborate, learn, and contribute to exciting open-source projects! Let’s connect and create something amazing together.
