# Hi, I'm Nima 👋

I'm a Computer Science B.Sc. graduate with a strong focus on **machine learning**, **Python-based data analysis**, and **EV powertrain engineering**.

- ⚙️ Working on **high-voltage battery (HVB)** and **e-motor** production lines  
  (Mercedes-Benz, Audi) – layouts, test concepts & process documentation
- 🤖 Interested in **battery aging modeling**, **predictive maintenance**  
  and **data-driven process optimization** in manufacturing
- 🐍 Tech stack: **Python** (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib),  
- 🧠 Also into computer vision (e.g. edge detection projects) and applied AI in industry

## What I'm working on

- Exploring ideas at the intersection of **AI + EV manufacturing**
